details:
    - The Employee Portal absorbs information that was scattered between Kalamazoo Valley's public website, intranet, and access portal.
    - Information was difficult to find, as it may have existed in one of those three places, and they frequently linked between one another. This was so problematic that less technical users found it difficult to determine or distinguish between the different locations information could be stored at.
    - Maintaining all the information was cumbersome as well, so we were able to centralize a place for modifications to be made, and the pages that exist within are parsing Markdown instead of having to write HTML.

contributions:
    - I handled the architecture and functionality for modifying and searching for content within the portal itself; as well as the deployment pipeline for the application.
    - Kerri did a ton of work collecting, categorizing, and sifting through a lot of content in a way that made sense to break down.
    - Ana continues to help keep content fresh and up to date.

obstacles:
    - "The sheer amount of information made it very time-consuming to organize and get ready for a production deployment."
    - "Getting feedback from users was particularly difficult, because there were so many users to get feedback from, and many users wanted different things displayed contextually."
