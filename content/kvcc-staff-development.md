details:
    - The Staff Development Registration System is a robust internal registration system for employees at Kalamazoo Valley to register for employment related training and new employee on-boarding.
    - Events can be categorized, have multiple event leaders (facilitators). Individual users can be registered, cancel their registrations, and be marked as complete for an attended event.
    - Administrators can create new events with a multitude of criteria like available seating, location, begin and end date-times, and manage the status of the events.
    - For ease of use for administrators or facilitators, sign-in sheets can be printed from the system, and each event has an exportable iCalendar file to add to their digital calendars.

contributions:
    - Ana handled prototyping and design aspects for the interface.
    - Ana and I split responsibilities on dealing with things for the front-end, but she handled most of it. We both attended meetings monthly with our internal clients in Human Resources and the Faculty Success Center.
    - I handled the entirety of the back-end MVC functionality and data/architectural definitions.

obstacles:
    - This was my first adventure into entirely back-end application coding. I learned so much!
    - With any complex system, there had to be checks for users to commit actions. In this case they came from Active Directory. Limiting access or restricting what users could do within each route of MVC wasn't too bad, but was definitely a great learning experience for me.
    - Displaying large amounts of information in a sane manner to administrators was tricky and time-consuming. It can be really difficult to make things fluid for them to work with and still be cost-effective to implement.
    - iCalendar exporting was more fragile than I had anticipated it to be.
