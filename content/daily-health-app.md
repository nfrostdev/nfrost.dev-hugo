details:
    - I found a poster I liked about self-care and wanted to make it into something a bit more usable. A little checklist application came to mind, and seemed simple enough.
    - The checked items reset nightly at midnight based on the system time, no authentication is required, and no tracking for the site.

contributions:
    - This was a small project done entirely by me.

obstacles:
    - The most difficult part of this project was finding the right icon to go with each list item. Many of these are subjective.
    - The original poster had 50 entries with some redundancies. So comparing and eliminating things that were very similar was a bit time-consuming.
    - Wording of some original poster elements was intended to start doing something, not continue doing something. So I changed the wording up a bit to include more continuity as opposed to starting new things.
