contributors:
    - Solo Project

location: https://grocerieslist.app/

languages:
    - JavaScript
    - HTML
    - SCSS

technologies:
    - Firebase
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Vue.js

details:
    - I made a simple app just for managing grocery lists without a bunch of ads or needing to sign in.
    - I wanted something simple, that just worked when I went there and did what I needed it to do; and this is the concept I came up with.

contributions:
    - I worked on the entirety of this project from start to finish. It was a fun and easy little side project.

obstacles:
    - Parent/child event propagation isn't ever really fun.
    - Interacting with the navigator's share API was simpler than I thought it would be.
    - Some niche bugs were introduced when I changed the route parameter to use uuidv4 instead of just the index of the lists array in the central application store.
