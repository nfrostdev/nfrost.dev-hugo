details:
    - As Kalamazoo Valley's digital infrastructure is being refined, it was necessary to isolate online employee training to a single place for convenience of both maintainers and users.

contributions:
    - Ana handled prototyping for the site with Figma. Andrea and I worked on getting the code in place with Hugo.

obstacles:
    - The biggest hurdle here was settling on some coding architecture for maintaining individual training listings.
    - Other than that, the search feature was probably the most complication portion of this project, written with just vanilla JavaScript.
