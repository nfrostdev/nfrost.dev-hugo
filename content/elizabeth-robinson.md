details:
    - Elizabeth Robinson's site is an informational site with information about her areas of specialty as an attorney, with details of services provided and ways to contact her.

contributions:
    - Ana handled most of the content and initial hierarchy and earlier prototypes of the site, as well as most of the core design choices.
    - I handled some revisions to prototyping and overall code structure, as well as some other architectural refinements.

obstacles:
    - We wanted to find a good and free solution for handling the contact form that didn't require us to spin up another server or have code running on a back-end somewhere.
    - Ultimately Google Forms was used because it's free and easy to manage, integration within the site and sending information over to the Google form was all handled through JavaScript and was an interesting experience, to say the least.
