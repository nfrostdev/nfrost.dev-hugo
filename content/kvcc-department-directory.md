contributors:
    - Chad Cunningham

location: https://departments.kvcc.edu/

languages:
    - C#
    - HTML
    - SCSS
    - JavaScript
    - SQL

technologies:
    - .NET
    - Vue.js
    - Docker
    - Tailwind CSS
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL

details:
    - The Department Directory is a counterpart to the Employee Directory to assist users with finding the right person or group at Kalamazoo Valley.
    - There is no formal department system set up in our central data source, so this application has an administrative interface for users to manage the data within.

contributions:
    - Chad created the back-end functionality for the public API and administration API with .NET. I made the front-end with Vue.js, and the component system for front-end functionality in this project.

obstacles:
    - Kalamazoo Valley had a department directory built that was similar in functionality to what we created, but it was made in the early 2000s.
    - The most complex portion of this project was the keyword functionality. How keywords work was more complicated than I thought it would be, especially from a perspective where you want to avoid database redundancy.
