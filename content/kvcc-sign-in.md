contributors:
    - KVCC Web Development Team

location: https://signin.kvcc.edu/

languages:
    - HTML
    - JavaScript
    - SCSS

technologies:
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Vue.js
    - Firebase

details:
    - The sign in application is an intermediary web page to get users to where they need to go.
    - Previously users would have to log in to a user portal first, and then decide where they wanted to go. This was a waste of bandwidth and time for the user, so having a dedicated online application authentication flow was good overall for everyone.
    - We can display notices to users about outages or upcoming downtime and events before they happen.

contributions:
    - I am the sole contributor to this project as far as concepts, code, and deployment goes.
    - I received feedback from the web team at KVCC, but handled prototyping, code, and CICD by myself.

obstacles:
    - As usual, diplomacy in the institution made it difficult to get the project off the ground until it was an emergency.
    - Determining what all services are actually present in the containers was probably the most difficult portion of deciding direction for the project.
