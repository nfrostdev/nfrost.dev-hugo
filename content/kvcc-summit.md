technologies:

    - JWT
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Vue.js

details:
    - The Summit site is a specific web application containing information about the schedule and keynote speakers for the bi-annual event held at Kalamazoo Valley Community College for employees.
    - Users have to sign in to view the restricted information, which all happens via Keycloak and JavaScript.

contributions:
    - Ana handled the majority of content in the application. I handled the majority of code architecture and authentication requirements.

obstacles:
    - As with any larger project, determining appropriate component structure for necessary abstraction was a bit more time-consuming than I wanted it to be.
    - A larger obstacle was the actual design and display for the schedule page. Displaying and portraying time-based events with multiple concurrent sessions was difficult, but I think we came up with a good solution.
